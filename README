This repository (HTML5-Geo) holds all of the code for the examples in the 
book "HTML5 Geolocation" by Anthony T. Holdener III (O'Reilly). The examples 
are broken down by chapter so that they are easier to locate.

You may use the code found in this repository free of charge. In general, 
you do not need to contact the author for permission unless you are 
reproducing a significant portion of the code. I appreciate, but do not 
require attribution. An attribution usually includes the title, author, 
publisher, and ISBN. For example: 
  "HTML5 Geolocation" by Anthony T. Holdener III (O'Reilly). Copyright (c) 
  2011 Anthony T. Holdener III. 978-1-449-30472-0.

If you feel your use of code examples falls outside fair use or the 
permission given above, feel free to contact O'Reilly Media at
